The Gemini API provides safety settings that you can adjust during the
prototyping stage to determine if your application requires a more or less
restrictive safety configuration. You can adjust these settings across four
filter categories to restrict or allow certain types of content.

This guide covers how the Gemini API handles safety settings and filtering and
how you can change the safety settings for your application.
| **Note:** Applications that use less restrictive safety settings may be subject to review. See the [Terms of Service](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#use-restrictions) for more information.

## Safety filters

The Gemini API's adjustable safety filters cover the following categories:

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| Harassment | Negative or harmful comments targeting identity and/or protected attributes. |
| Hate speech | Content that is rude, disrespectful, or profane. |
| Sexually explicit | Contains references to sexual acts or other lewd content. |
| Dangerous | Promotes, facilitates, or encourages harmful acts. |

These categories are defined in [`HarmCategory`](https://ai.google.dev/api/rest/v1/HarmCategory). You
can use these filters to adjust what's appropriate for your use case. For
example, if you're building video game dialogue, you may deem it acceptable to
allow more content that's rated as *Dangerous* due to the nature of the game.

In addition to the adjustable safety filters, the Gemini API has built-in
protections against core harms, such as content that endangers child safety.
These types of harm are always blocked and cannot be adjusted.

### Content safety filtering level

The Gemini API categorizes the probability level of content being unsafe as
`HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`, or `NEGLIGIBLE`.

The Gemini API blocks content based on the probability of content being unsafe
and not the severity. This is important to consider because some content can
have low probability of being unsafe even though the severity of harm could
still be high. For example, comparing the sentences:

1. The robot punched me.
2. The robot slashed me up.

The first sentence might result in a higher probability of being unsafe, but you
might consider the second sentence to be a higher severity in terms of violence.
Given this, it is important that you carefully test and consider what the
appropriate level of blocking is needed to support your key use cases while
minimizing harm to end users.

### Safety filtering per request

You can adjust the safety settings for each request you make to the API. When
you make a request, the content is analyzed and assigned a safety rating. The
safety rating includes the category and the probability of the harm
classification. For example, if the content was blocked due to the harassment
category having a high probability, the safety rating returned would have
category equal to `HARASSMENT` and harm probability set to `HIGH`.

Due to the model's inherent safety, additional filters are **Off** by default.
If you choose to enable them, you can configure the system to block content
based on its probability of being unsafe. The default model behavior covers most
use cases, so you should only adjust these settings if consistently is required
for your application.

The following table describes the block settings you can adjust for each
category. For example, if you set the block setting to **Block few** for the
**Hate speech** category, everything that has a high probability of being hate
speech content is blocked. But anything with a lower probability is allowed.

| Threshold (Google AI Studio) | Threshold (API) | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Off | `OFF` | Turn off the safety filter |
| Block none | `BLOCK_NONE` | Always show regardless of probability of unsafe content |
| Block few | `BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH` | Block when high probability of unsafe content |
| Block some | `BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE` | Block when medium or high probability of unsafe content |
| Block most | `BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE` | Block when low, medium or high probability of unsafe content |
| N/A | `HARM_BLOCK_THRESHOLD_UNSPECIFIED` | Threshold is unspecified, block using default threshold |

If the threshold is not set, the default block threshold is **Off** for Gemini
2.5 and 3 models.

You can set these settings for each request you make to the generative service.
See the [`HarmBlockThreshold`](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#harmblockthreshold) API
reference for details.

### Safety feedback

[`generateContent`](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#method:-models.generatecontent)
returns a
[`GenerateContentResponse`](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#generatecontentresponse) which
includes safety feedback.

Prompt feedback is included in
[`promptFeedback`](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#promptfeedback). If
`promptFeedback.blockReason` is set, then the content of the prompt was blocked.

Response candidate feedback is included in
[`Candidate.finishReason`](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#candidate) and
[`Candidate.safetyRatings`](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#candidate). If response
content was blocked and the `finishReason` was `SAFETY`, you can inspect
`safetyRatings` for more details. The content that was blocked is not returned.

## Adjust safety settings

This section covers how to adjust the safety settings in both Google AI Studio
and in your code.

### Google AI Studio

You can adjust safety settings in Google AI Studio.

Click **Safety settings** under **Advanced settings** in the **Run settings** panel to open the **Run
safety settings** modal. In the modal, you can use the sliders to adjust the
content filtering level per safety category:

![](https://ai.google.dev/static/gemini-api/docs/images/safety_settings_ui.png)
| **Note:** You are responsible for ensuring that safety settings for your intended use case comply with the [Terms of Service](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#use-restrictions).

When you send a request (for example, by asking the model a question), a warning
**Content blocked** message appears if the request's content is blocked. To see
more details, hold the pointer over the
**Content blocked** text to see the category and the probability of the harm
classification.

### Code examples

The following code snippet shows how to set safety settings in your
`GenerateContent` call. This sets the threshold for the hate speech
(`HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH`) category. Setting this category to
`BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE` blocks any content that has a low or higher probability of
being hate speech. To understand the threshold settings, see [Safety filtering
per request](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/safety-settings#safety-filtering-per-request).
